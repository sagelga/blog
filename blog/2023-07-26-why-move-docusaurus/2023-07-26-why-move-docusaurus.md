When you are talking about creating a hobby of blogging, the benefits of sharing your thoughts, and your new ideas, your passion is there, and it serves everyone. Even though it is not your main objective, the benefits of public exposure are there for you to grab. You will be known as a people who do blogging and you can brag that to all your friends that you get exposed by famous companies.

And that is me. I want to express my knowledge and trying to practice my writing, programming, and learning skills to the test with all of these blogging. But how can I do that?

<!--truncate-->

## Commitment to the habit

In my experience, you have to commit to the habit of blogging. If you are a blogger, you have to understand that people want promises and constant value from your content. But you are a new blogger. Understanding how to achieve these lofty goals is still early.

If you want to start these habits, you can start by using popular blogging sites like [Medium](https://medium.com), [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com) and self-hosting [WordPress](https://wordpress.org). Even though you won't have full control over how you want your content to look and feel, it's still something. Still, I have no doubt in my mind that you can do it.

I don't want to scare you off right from the start, but listen to what I have to say. When you get to the point where you feel that blogging is becoming you, you will feel that you want to do more than just create content. You want readers to feel the experiences that have your name on them. Like me, you want to have your own domain (like byteside.one), a lightning-fast content delivery network, and optimise the way people read and explore your other amazing content.

This is me. I am already there. I've tried them all and I'm still not happy with the inability to customise, the constant maintenance issues and the poor reading experience for my readers. I've been blogging for about 3 years now and I've been through most of the nooks and crannies of all these services. Believe me, you want more when you know you can.

## Upgrade to the next level

So during my studies on software development for my career, I have experienced with ReactJS framework; and I have to say that there are big communities in this framework. So do that I felt in love with this framework.

And during that process I learned that they also have something called 'Docusaurus'. and it works by converting your writing in .txt, .md, or .mdx into an HTML file (aka website page) so that everyone can read your content on the internet while you have full control over how your content is styled.

It was at this moment that I struck struct gold with my blogging problem. It gave me:

-   Complete customisation of styling and functionality
-   Content is static, so no need to host your content on a server
-   Lightning fast page load times
-   No paywall for viewers
-   Integrates with your GitHub repository
-   Active Docusaurus community
-   Unlock the power of React within your blog post by your knowledge, not a server limit or website rule
-   ... and show off your knowledge of computer languages like ReactJS, JavaScript, CSS and HTML

This is how I did it with Docusaurus.

### How much is Docusaurus?

None. Nil. Zilch. Zero. Docusaurus is open source, which means you can use its framework for free. Most of what you pay for is the time it takes to create the content and customise your masterpiece to your liking.

\*You can optionally purchase a custom domain (like [sagelga.com](https://sagelga.com)), a page builder (Netlify, GitHub Actions), and a code hosting site (Amazon S3, GitHub, GitHub Pages) to streamline your development in Docusaurus.

## Create your own Docusaurus website

In my current settings, here's how I get my blog up and running:

-   **GitHub** to store my blog content
-   **Netlify** to deploy my code from GitHub so it can be viewed
-   **CloudFlare** to improve content delivery, DNS, and other things needed to get these content to my readers as fast as possible
-   **Microsoft Clarity** for website analytics
-   **Google Search Console & Bing Search Console** to get the famous search engine to start crawling and indexing my site
